**GLOBAL PLASTIC WASTE REPORT ANALYSIS FOR THE YEAR 2023**

Global Plastic Waste Report Analysis for the Year 2023 is a comprehensive overview of plastic waste production, recycling rates, and environmental impact across 165 countries. The analysis was to analyze plastic waste production, recycling rates, and its environmental impact. This dataset provides a detailed analysis of global plastic waste production and management across 165 countries for the year 2023. The data encompasses multiple aspects of plastic waste handling, from production volumes to recycling efficiency and environmental risk assessment. The data set was gotten from Kaggle.com.


**OBSERVATIONS**

The following observations were made:

1. Japan has the highest sum total of recycling rate compared to the other countries, this implies that Japan is doing a good job when it comes to managing plastic waste and recycling.
2. The country with the highest plastic waste production is China with a total of 59.08% as against the other countries. This can be attributed to the population of the China as a country as it stands as the world most populated country.
3. Consumer packaging stands as the highest main source of plastic waste across all of the 165 countries used for this analysis. Its save to say that there more plastic waste around as a result of packaging goods and items bought for consumers as against the other sources like industrial packaging, packaging industrial etc.
4. Coastal waste risk assessment across all 165 countries is high with a total of 43.99%
5. Per capita waste production (kg/person) has Iceland seating at the top of the chart with a total of 1564 Kg compared to other countries. This implies that Iceland has more persons that produce plastic waste compared to other countries.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

The following recommendations was made:

1. There should be a global sensitization and awareness that plastic wastes can be recycled and in turn generate funds for individual and countries in general.

2. Countries that have not been able to manage their plastic waste production should learn from Japan, and inculcate the methods and mechanisms put in place by Japan that is helping them record more success when it comes to plastic waste recycling.

3. Companies and businesses should learn to use other means in packaging their products and should focus more on trying not to use plastic items to package their products as this help contribute the more plastic production waste in the environment.

4. Plastic waste can be gathered and burnt to avoid been littered in the environment as most people will not think twice to discard them properly and when not properly discarded, they block drainages and water ways which sometimes leads to erosion when the rains come and contribute to the pollution of the environment.
